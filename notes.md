the default runs if none of the cases match

break stops the switch statement being ran

dispatch says which case to run

reducer takes two parameter { 1. state 2. action

    const [items, dispatch] = useReducer()

    exp: function itemsReducer(items, action) {
        switch(action.type) {
            case
        }
    }

}
